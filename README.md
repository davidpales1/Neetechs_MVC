# Neetechs.com

Neetechs.com is a website that will allow tech geeks to post their idea and experience. It also allows
them to boost their skill by learning from other geeks in the home section or by learning from the
learning section. Neetechs.com also allows people to post their services which also allows other people
to hire their skills.

To Create this website:

1. First, I will create the login and registration system.
2. Second, I will create the profile page.
3. Settings Page
4. The home page will contain the creation post and the list.
5. The left sidebar will contain some fast links to the important page of the website.
6. The right sidebar will contain some ads or maybe some future updates.
7. The navbar will have a search bar and the logo, home, services, products, profile,
    messages, notification buttons. Login and a logout button.
8. The notification system (I am not sure if I have time to complete it)
9. The chatting System
10. Finally, I will create a dashboard for organizing the services, products, and Posts

The Programing languages and the other techniques that will be used are:

```
 Pure HTML (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery)
 MVC in the backend
 WebApi and React for the dashboard if I have the time to create it.
```
The class that I will add to create the website:
